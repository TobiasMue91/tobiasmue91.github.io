# GPTGames
Simple HTML games and tools created with ChatGPT.

---

**Disclaimer:**

~99.3% of the code has been written and improved by ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com/
(0.7% were debugging and minor styling tweaks done by me)

Some games contain assets (mainly background images). The images have been generated with the help of MidJourney and some sounds have been taken from pixabay.

No cookies, tracking or server-sided data saving is done in this project. All tools are client-sided, limited to JS, CSS and HTML and therefore somewhat safe to use. 

Some data is stored in firebase and firestore. (highscores in Flappy Bird, savegames in Family Feud and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and plans from the Household Planner)
